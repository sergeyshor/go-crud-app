# go-crud-app

It is an educational project. Main goal was to understand how to organize backend Golang projects. I have made a Twitter-based CRUD application using Golang to understand it. 

My project layout was inspired by Github repositories that contain templates of Golang projects organized using Robert Martin's and some other repositories:

1. https://github.com/bxcodec/go-clean-arch
2. https://github.com/evrone/go-clean-template
3. https://github.com/nurcahyaari/golang-starter
